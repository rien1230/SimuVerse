SimuVerse is a small-group social simulation that explores how emotions and dialogue shape trust, conflict, and contagion. Four lightweight agents run on a seeded Mesa engine with personality, short/long-term memory, goals, and a simple mood model (valence–arousal). You can watch an automatic baseline or run an experiment by tweaking agent personalities. Short user inputs like “I feel ignored” are classified (GoEmotions) and injected into the world; agent dialogue is generated with a Concordia-style loop (goals + memory + context → ChatGPT) behind safety moderation. A live 2D viewer shows avatars, expressions, and colour-coded relationship ties as the story unfolds.

The project is built for reproducibility and evaluation: deterministic seeds, per-tick JSONL logs, exact replay, and clear metrics (polarisation, contagion speed, conflict rate) with simple ablations (LLM on/off, emotion on/off). Tech stack: Python (Mesa) core with a REST/WebSocket API, a React + Canvas viewer, and a thin SQLite/PostgreSQL layer for run metadata and artifact links. Ethics by design: consent banner, no PII in storage, ephemeral user text, and moderated outputs. Intended for teaching, coursework, and research demos where clarity, auditability, and repeatability matter.
